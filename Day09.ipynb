    "With your neighbor happily enjoying their video game, you turn your attention to an open data port on the little screen in the seat in front of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the port is non-standard, you manage to connect it to your computer through the clever use of several paperclips. Upon connection, the port outputs a series of numbers (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data appears to be encrypted with the eXchange-Masking Addition System (XMAS) which, conveniently for you, is an old cypher with an important weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "XMAS starts by transmitting a preamble of 25 numbers. After that, each number you receive should be the sum of any two of the 25 immediately previous numbers. The two numbers will have different values, and there might be more than one such pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose your preamble consists of the numbers `1` through `25` in a random order. To be valid, the next number must be the sum of two of those numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `26` would be a valid next number, as it could be `1` plus `25` (or many other pairs, like `2` and `24`).\n",
    "* `49` would be a valid next number, as it is the sum of `24` and `25`.\n",
    "* `100` would not be valid; no two of the previous 25 numbers sum to `100`.\n",
    "* `50` would also not be valid; although `25` appears in the previous 25 numbers, the two numbers in the pair must be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the 26<sup>th</sup> number is `45`, and the first number (no longer an option, as it is more than 25 numbers ago) was `20`. Now, for the next number to be valid, there needs to be some pair of numbers among `1`-`19`, `21`-`25`, or `45` that add up to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `26` would still be a valid next number, as `1` and `25` are still within the previous 25 numbers.\n",
    "* `65` would not be valid, as no two of the available numbers sum to it.\n",
    "* `64` and 66 would both be valid, as they are the result of `19+45` and `21+45` respectively.\n",
